Caesar Cipher. 

A Caesar cipher, also known as a Caesar shift or a shift cipher, is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encryption. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This fixed number is often referred to as the "key" or "shift value."

The user determines how many positions each letter in the plaintext will be shifted in the alphabet. The program will output the corresponding encrypted message. To decrypt, user will need to enter the encrypted message along with the shift number.
